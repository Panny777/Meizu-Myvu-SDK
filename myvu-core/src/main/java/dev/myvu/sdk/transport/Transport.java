 * A bidirectional link to the glasses carrying UNFRAMED protocol payloads.

 * framing (BLE fragments into little-endian sn-prefixed packets; RFCOMM wraps
 * in eaca9353 + big-endian length) to byte-identical payloads. Everything above
 * this interface -- the relay layer, the session handshake, every feature --
 * is transport-agnostic, which is exactly why the same Session/Relay code
 * serves both.
 *
 * Implementations report asynchronously through a {@link TransportListener};
 * no method here blocks on the remote device.
